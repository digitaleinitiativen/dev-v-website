    Icarus is a responsive and customizable theme for bloggers. It’s a port of the same-named theme for Hexo made by Ruipeng Zhang. Noteworthy features of this Hugo theme are the integration of a comment-system powered by Disqus, localization (l10n) support, syntax highlighting for source code, optional widgets for the sidebar and a handful shortcodes to make your life easier. Get the theme I assume you’ve Git installed. Inside the folder of your Hugo site run mkdirthemes cd themes $ git clone git@github.com:digitalcraftsman/hugo-icarus-theme.git You should see a folder called hugo-icarus-theme inside the themes directory that we created a few moments ago.
