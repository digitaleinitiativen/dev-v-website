Jim, you are a Designer. give me word rap: 
(sorry if it didn't "rap" I had no mic :D) I beatboxed while typing though.

**1) Most important technology for the next 10 yrs**

personal fabrication and manufacturing. More and more tools are getting available for the common man that enables to create personal technologies. As the next generation of adult are growing up right now with access of information at their fingertips it's inevitable that amazing new creations for personal creation will see the light of day. Geeks rule the world after all :)


**2) Biggest fail of our industry**

For me the biggest fail of the industry is to not have thought what happens with the product after the product's life cycle. More energy and research has been invested in how fast and precise a product will fail; called planned obsolescence instead of making sure the product stays relevant and reliable. I believe we as a society would be far more advanced if we'd chosen the non-for-profit engineering approach some decennia ago.



**3) Change you are looking forward to:**

In general I'd love to see what people create… a lot has changed already in the past years. access to affordable technology has increased (arduino, adafruit, raspberry pi, 3d printer, internet) the only thing remaining is to lessen our thirst for consumerism and start to look around to create a better society for ourself… big companies are not going to do it for us since… no profit in that.



**4) Projects you want to start**

I'd like to start with upcycling. I find this a very interesting concept. I have a strong interest in making new things from old… and in ways that has not been done before…. or depending on my or other people's needs. an engineer in china or something can not foresee what exactly waht I need in a product or how I could combine it with something else. that is something I would like to do or offer as a service. the tools to achieve this are multiple. only thing needed is expertise and access to raw material (plastic, electronic, ideas)


**5) Goals we should target in Vorarlberg, Globally**

There should be more hackerspaces and fablabs available in Vorarlberg where you could meet up like minded people to share ideas or have access to advanced tools.
Um Hüsle is a very good initiative but should be available whole year around… so that its not concentrated on one time point. although the event is fantastic… it's not enough to create massive momentum in awakening the sleeping creative potential that is available in the general public. 




**6) Ressources you like or  discovered recently**

plastics…  It's incredibl how much plastic is being wasted which is still fully usable and recyclable. its an untapped goldmine for personal fabrication. It would be great if the majority of this plastic was collected locally and reused as filament or other products so we can keep the plastics away from the trash. It can even bring people together I believe since there is also an untapped creative potential if people consume less and participate in the product creation.
just imagine the possibilities!
